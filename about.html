						<strong>What is a Coronavirus?</strong>
						<p class="text-about">Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness
							in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory
							infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East
							Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most
							recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.</p>
						<br>
						<strong>What is COVID-19</strong>
						<p class="text-about">COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently
							discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak
							began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.</p>

						<br>
						<strong>What are the Symptoms of COVID-19?</strong>
						<p class="text-about">The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry
							cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or
							diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected
							but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from
							the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets
							COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those
							with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are
							more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing
							should seek medical attention.
						</p>
						<br>
						<strong>How does COVID-19 spread?</strong>
						<p class="text-about">People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease
							can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are
							spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and
							surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or
							surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they
							breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is
							why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.

							WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share
							updated findings.
						</p>
						<br>
						<strong class="text-about-in">Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?</strong>
						<p class="text-about-in-text">Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is
							mainly
							transmitted through
							contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air. See previous answer on
							“How
							does COVID-19 spread?”</p>
						<br>
						<strong class="text-about-in">Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?</strong>

						<p class="text-about-in-text">The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets
							expelled by someone who is
							coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very
							low.
							However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly
							true
							at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from
							someone
							who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill. WHO is assessing ongoing
							research on the period of transmission of COVID-19 and will continue to share updated
							findings.</p>
						<br>
						<strong class="text-about-in">Can I catch COVID-19 from the feces of someone with the disease?</strong>

						<p class="text-about-in-text">The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person
							appears to be low. While
							initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread
							through this route is not a main feature of the outbreak. WHO is assessing ongoing
							research
							on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings. Because this is
							a
							risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly, after using the bathroom
							and
							before eating.</p>
